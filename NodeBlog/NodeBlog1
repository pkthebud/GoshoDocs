    Blog 2015-10-25
        SO Yeah
            I've been working on my crappy rails version
            so long that it's starting to gather dust
            Work has finally eased off a bit...
            Time to check out what node can really do

    Github for the win
        Github for the win
            all hail eddywashere for the 
            many starred node-stripe-membership-saas
            lets have a look...

                Preflight
                    node installed - check
                    mongodb installed - check

                Config
                    the file /server/config/secrets.js needs
                    my stripe keys which are... wahayhayhay-it a minnit...
                    And also the plans I'm going to offer
                    Sounds good so far... :/

                Account
                    Mailgun - Signed in looks good
                    Stripe - agh yeah yeah no ok yeah ok good now
                    Secret key - ok this is to do with express clearly

                Told you I know nothing!
                    Just changed the secret key to some random phrase - ok good
                    We are moving, we are moving!

                Google Analytics
                    Yeah so ad tech ad tech and more ad tech eh?
                    ok why not - I'm ashamed to say that 
                    I've never used it - but that's easily fixed
                    who doesn't have a google account these days...

                Ok all set 
                    Config is a go - let's do this
                    ... what do I do again? ...
                    oh yeah - npm install

    Node Node Node

                    Ok - were up on port 3000, 
                    with a mongoose warning
                    but still up on port 3000

                    all... lower... case... ids...

    Are we done?
        // 
        The Reveal
            Can we get some other color up in here?
            I'm going for navbar-default background #599CB6
            and AAD6EA for the highlight 
            other than the jules is tip top


                // pic site.jpg
                Change the title 
                    and we are a go 
                    looks pretty good for technically 
                    an hour plus blog time :D
