        Introduction (t   20 9 26 5 18)            
             Preamble
             A derivative can be defined as a financial instrument
             whose value depends or is derived from
             the values of other more basic underlying variables
        Exchange Traded Markets
             Chicago Mercantile exchange est 1919
             Chicago Board options Exchange est 1973
             Electronic Markets
             More popular than the open outcry system
        Over the counter markets
             OTC market much larger than exchanges
             Particpants can negotiate any price they want – more of a credit risk than exchanges
                 Market Size
                     Bank for International setllements www.bis.com
                     Estimated OTC contracts outstanding in 2004 == $6.4 trillion
                     Forward Contracts
                                                     
        Forward Contract:
             An agreement to buy – or sell – an asset
             at a certain future time
             for a certain future price
             usually witnessed somehow taped converstaion - ledger etc...
 
                 Often used to hedge foreign currency risk:
                     contractually agreeing to buy money in the future at a price agreed today
                     In order to then take that money and pay a bill to a foreign supplier
                 Spot Contract:
                     An agreement to buy – or sell – an asset today
                 Long position:
                     Agrees to buy the contract at a future date for a specified price
                 Short position:
                     Agrees to sell the contract on that date for the specified price
 
 
        Payoffs from Forward Contracts (1)
             If the price to buy a british pound rises
             then to buy a million british pounds at an already agreed future date,
             such a contract is worth tens of  thousands in saved money
             K == the delivery Price
             ST == The spot price of the asset at maturity of the contract
              
        Payoffs from Forward Contracts (2)
             A short position wil return K ST
             A short position wil return ST – K
             These returns can be either positive or negative and 
             represents the payoff from entering the contract
 
        Forward prices and Spot prices
             ? bad example ? – what?                             
        Futures contracts
             Different to forward contracts – because
             they are traded on an exchange
             gives both paties a guarantee that the contract will be honoured

        Futures contracts 
             Future contracts determine the price of things because
             If more traders want to go long than short – the price goes up
             If more traders want to go short than long – the price goes down
 
        Futures contracts 
             Why do futures markets exist?
             1. To enable planning of production and consumption
             2. To enable price discovery
        
        Options (1)
             Traded OTC and on exhanges
                 Price quoted in an options contract – is called a:
                     Strike price or an
                     Excercise price
                 The date quoted in the options contract – is called an:
                     Expiration date or
                     Maturity
        Options (2)
             There are two types of options 
             both are bought and sold by options traders:
                 Call Option:
                     The right to buy a certain asset by a certain date - for a certain price
                 Put Option:
                     The right to sell a certain asset by a certain date - for a certain price
        Options (3)
             American Options:
             Can be excerised at any time up to the expiration date
             opaque & hard to analyse
             value is often deduced from it’s eurpean conterparts
                 European options:
                     Can only be exercised on the expiration date    
                     Chicago Board Options Exchange  (CBOE)
 
                 Difference between futures and forward contracts
                     f&f contracts cost nothing to enter into
                     But you must pay for the right to exercise an option
                     F&f contracts must be honoured
                     but you do not have to exercise the right afforded to you by owning an option contract
                                                                                    
                 Example:
                     1 option == the right to
                     call upon 100 shares to buy at the agreed price or
                     put down to sell 100 shares at the agreed price
                     – when the agreed date comes around
 
                 If you purchase the option to buy in October
                     and from May onwards the stock does well
                     then when October comes around you can exercise the option to buy at a lesser price an make a profit
                     If the stock does badly
                     You lose your initial investment
        Types of Traders
             Derivative markets have become outstaningly succesful
             and have a lot of liquidity
             because of the many different types of traders:
                 Hedgers 
                     reducing the risk of potential price shifts
                 Speculators
                 Aribitrageurs 
                     take offsetting positions in two or more instruments to lock in a profit -(ie: buy in one - sell in the other)
                 Hedge funds 
                     Use derivatives for all three purposes
 
        Business Snapshot
             Mutual funds
             are required to register under US federal securities law
             shares in Mutual funds must be fairly priced and redeemable at all times
             investment policies must be disclosed
             no short positions can be taken.
                 Hedge funds
                     are not required to register under US federal securities law
                     they do not advertise their services to the public at large
                     are free to create proprietary investment strategys of great complexity
                     Typically charge 1 or 2 % on amt invested - plus 20% of any accrued profits
 
                 Hedge Fund manager:
                     Investment strategy often involves using derivatives to set up a:
                     Speculative position or a Arbitrage position
                 Once they have a strategy they must:
                     Evaluate the risks to which the fund is exposed
                     Decide which risks are acceptable and which must be hedged
                     Devise strategies (usually involving derivatives ) to hedge the unacceptable risks
                 Terms:
                     Convertable Arbitrage   
                     Long in convertible bond but short in the underlying equity  
                 Distressed Securities      
                     Buy securities issued from a bankrupt company 
                 Emerging Markets           
                     Invest in debt & equity of companies in emerging markets and the debt of the countries themselves
                 Growth Fund                     
                     Invest in growth stocks hedging with short sales of options
                 Macro or Global                
                     Use derivatives to speculate on intrest rate and foreign exchange rate moves
                 Market Neutral                 
                     Buy overvalued securities and sell undervalued securities in such a way that overall exposure to market direction is always neutral      
        Hedgers
            An Example of Hedging Using Options
                An Example of Hedging Using Forward Contracts
                    Export and Import Co hedging on imports & exports to from GB to/from USA
                Key aspect of hedging:
                    The cost for the underlying asset is assured - when buying
                    And the  price recieved for the underlying asset is assured - when selling
                    But there is no guarantee that the outcome with hedging will be better than the outcome without hedging
                   
                A Comparison
                    Options have an upfront fee they allow an investor to insure themselves against adverse price changes
                    Forward contracts are free to enter into - but commit you to buying/selling at a certain price in the future therby neutralizing the risk of any price change in between 
        Speculators
            An example of speculation using futures
            Price of pounds sterling is going to rise you think - so buy 4 futures contracts which will cost (at a specified date £62,000)
            The price of pounds rises so you have made a profit of about $14,000  by using these future contracts which only cost you a deposit of around $20,000 in a margin account
                An example of speculation using options
                    Options if correctly planned == (difference between strike price and actual price) * quantity = profit
                    Options if incorrectly planned == the cost of the options purchase
                A comparison
                    When a speculator uses futures the potential loss can be just as big as the potential gain
                    When a speculator uses options the potential loss is limited to the price price paid for the options - Why not always trade with options???
        Arbitrageurs
            Abitrage involves locking in a riskless profit 
            by simultaneously entering into transactions 
            in two or more markets
                Arbitrage oppourtunities are rare 
                    because everyone is looking for them
                Example (1)
                    is of a stock that sells in the states for $172 a share and
                    sells for £100 a share in the UK
                    Where the exchange rate is $1.75 == £1
                Example (2)                        
                    Then $1.75 * 100 = 100 english shares è equivalent to $175
                    100 American shares == $172
                    Buy for $172 in US and sell for $175 in UK 
                    $3 profit per share... that’s arbitrage
                Example (3)        
                    Clearly based on lack of realisation from other market players
                    Lateral thinking clearly required to even realise an oppourtunity

            Moral: clearly set your risk limits              
        Dangers
            Derivatives are very versatile instruments
            Checks must be put in place to ensure that 
            they are being used for their intended purpose
            Also risk limits must be adhered to
        Summary
            This book is basically concerned with the valuation of derivatives
